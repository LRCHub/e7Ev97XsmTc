You know
I've been buried sleeping
Can't tell,
is my heart still beating?
Not sure
if it's worth this feeling
This feeling, no, no
All alone I've been
hitting the ground running
Every time that I felt like
I was close to giving up
'Cause I thought all of this was
worth something
Is it worth something?
Is it worth something?
Is it worth something?
Is it worth something?
Is it worth something?
Longer days, longer nights
Hide behind blurry eyes
Get out to get back inside
Can't count the steps I'm taking
Knowing those higher heights
Think I might lose my mind
At the sight of the sky
But I know
that you'll be waiting
I'm not sure
where we're going from here
Been off of the ground for about
half of the year
Longer days, longer nights
Hide behind blurry eyes
Get out to get back inside
But I know
that you'll be waiting
Same stories
in different skylines
Old city
with a brand new sunrise
I'm walking a fragile fine line
This fine line
All alone I've been
hitting the ground running
Every time that I felt like
I was close to giving up
'Cause I thought all of this was
worth something
Is it worth something?
Is it worth something?
Is it worth something?
Is it worth something?
Is it worth something?
Longer days, longer nights
Hide behind blurry eyes
Get out to get back inside
Can't count the steps I'm taking
Knowing those higher heights
Think I might lose my mind
At the sight of the sky
But I know
that you'll be waiting
I'm not sure
where we're going from here
Been off of the ground for about
half of the year
Longer days, longer nights
Hide behind blurry eyes
Get out to get back inside
But I know
that you'll be waiting
But I know
that you'll be waiting
But I know
that you'll be waiting
But I know
that you'll be waiting
But I know
that you'll be waiting
